## About project

This project demonstrates how to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using a Decision Tree Classifier in Python. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, focusing on achieving high accuracy while maintaining explainability ‚Äî crucial for medical diagnosis systems.

## Project Objective
To build an interpretable and efficient machine learning model that helps classify breast cancer diagnoses based on input features derived from cell nuclei present in digitalized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) tests
